**Author:** Harmandeep Gill

**Term:** Summer 2023
## Abstract
The objective of this lab was to gain familiarity with Java programming and the Git version control system. The lab focused on implementing polynomial operations in Java using a Polynomial class. The Polynomial class was designed to handle polynomial addition, evaluation, and root checking. The lab involved setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK), creating a Git repository, and implementing the Polynomial class. The implementation was tested by running a provided Driver class and verifying the expected output.

## 1. Introduction
Polynomials are widely used mathematical functions, and performing operations on them is a fundamental task in mathematics and computer science. In this lab, we aimed to implement a Polynomial class in Java that can handle polynomial addition, evaluation, and root checking. The Polynomial class represents a polynomial function with coefficients stored in an array. The lab required setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK), creating a Git repository, and implementing the Polynomial class according to the provided specifications.

## 2. Methods
### 2.1 Setting up the Development Environment
- Downloaded and installed the JDK from the Oracle website.
- Set up the JAVA_HOME environment variable on Windows.
- Installed Git on the local machine.

### 2.2 Creating a git repository
- Created a Github account if not already present.
- Generated a personal access token for authentication.
- Created a public repository named "b07lab1" on Github.

### 2.3 Implementing the Polynomial Class
- Created the Polynomial class with the necessary fields and methods.
- Defined a constructor to initialize the Polynomial with coefficients.
- Implemented the add() method to perform polynomial addition.
- Implemented the evaluate() method to evaluate the polynomial for a given value of x.
- Implemented the hasRoot() method to check if a given value is a root of the polynomial.

### 2.4 Testing the Implementation
- Created a Driver class with a main method to test the Polynomial class.
- Created instances of Polynomial and performed addition, evaluation, and root checking.
- Compiled the Java files using the javac command.
- Executed the program using the java command and verified the output

## 3. Conclusion
In this lab, we successfully implemented a Polynomial class in Java to handle polynomial operations. We learned how to set up the Java Development Kit (JDK), create a Git repository, and work with version control using Git. By implementing the Polynomial class, we gained a better understanding of object-oriented programming in Java and practiced using arrays, constructors, and methods. The lab provided hands-on experience in developing and testing a Java program from scratch, contributing to our overall understanding of Java programming and version control systems.
